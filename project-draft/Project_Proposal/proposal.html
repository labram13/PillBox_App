    <h1>INFO 340 Project Proposal</h1>

    <section>
      <h2>Problem/Data Domain</h2>
      <h3>1. Overview</h3>
      <p>
        As a group, we decided we wanted to tackle the issue of prescription
        medication adherence. The World Health Organization defines
        <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15910397" target="_blank"
          >adherence</a
        >
        as "the degree to which [a patient's] behavior corresponds with the
        agreed recommendations from a health care provider." When a patient
        forgets which meds they take, doesn't take the appropriate number of
        doses each week, and forgets to refill their prescriptions on time, they
        are exhibiting poor adherence, and there is a deterioration in their
        health outcomes. It also makes it harder for their healthcare provider
        to help them, since the patient isn't doing their part to stay on top of
        their health.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Information technology problem</h3>
      <p>
        Pronouncing and recalling long lists of medication names is no easy
        task. Many people struggle with communicating every medication they are
        on with their providers for those reasons. Further, keeping track of how
        many pills are left in a prescription medication bottle can be
        difficult. Doing so meticulously requires the physical dexterity and
        acuity of vision to handle little pills, as well as the intellectual
        capability of counting up to large numbers. Additionally, not all pill
        bottles are transparent, adding to the difficulty. Finally, resetting a
        pillbox each week can be challenging, because a patient must rely on
        their memory of the past week to reset the pillbox. Human memory is
        fallible, thus an information problem presents itself in that capacity.
      </p>

      <h3>3. What has already been tried</h3>
      <p>
        Physical pillboxes are an elegant solution to the issue of medication
        adherence. However, we hope to build on top of the limits of pillboxes
        to make adherence an even easier task for patients. The information
        problems in this area which we mention above are not currently
        adequately addressed by physical pillboxes.
        <a href="http://apps.smarthealthit.org/app/duke-pillbox" target="_blank"
          >Duke PillBox</a
        >
        is a preexisting attempt to address the issue of adherence. However, the
        app simply tells a patient's provider how good they are at keeping up
        with their doses. It does not actually empower the patient to do a
        better job of keeping track of their meds. At the end of the day,
        physicians can't take pills on their patient's behalf. Therefore Duke
        PillBox is not a robust solution to the issue.

      <h2>App Description</h2>
      <h3>1. Who are the users?</h3>
      <p>
        Patients with at least one medication prescription will compose our user
        base. A vast majority of our users will include individuals with
        multiple prescriptions. This app will ideally help those with complex
        and acute medical needs, as they are the folks who tend to be on a
        higher number of medications. When a large number of medications are
        prescribed it can be hard for the patients to keep track of when to use
        them, how frequently they need to take the drugs, and common symptoms
        that can come up. Furthermore, individuals with physical disabilities
        and the elderly stand to benefit greatly from the app, as they may not
        possess the fine motor skills needed to easily handle and count pills.
        Those with intellectual disabilities and, again, the elderly, are likely
        to be supported by our app, which handles dose counting and information
        storage on their behalf. Our application will allow those users to more
        easily stick with an adherence plan and feel like an empowered agent in
        the improvement of their own health.
      </p>

      <h3>2. What will the users do?</h3>
      <p>Users will be able to interact with three main features:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          First, they will be able to search a list of the
          <a
            href="https://clincalc.com/DrugStats/Top300Drugs.aspx"
            target="_blank"
            >300 most common medications</a
          >, then save the meds they take to a personal list which users can
          show their healthcare providers when they are physically at a checkup.
        </li>
        <li>
          Then, they will be able to sort their selected medications into a
          "weekly pill planner". The weekly pill planner will mirror what a
          patient's physical pill organizer should look like at the beginning of
          each week before the medications have been depleted.
        </li>
        <li>
         Finally, patients will be able to input the number of pills they have,
          as well as the number of pills they take each week, into a
          "prescription countdown" feature. At the end of each week, patients
          must check a box saying they took all of their pills that week.
          Checking the box will deduct the number of pills per week from the
          total number of pills. When the total number of pills is close to
          being completely depleted, users will be notified that it's time to
          contact their pharmacy or healthcare provider for a refill.
        </li>
      </ol>

        <h3>3. What kind of information will the users be viewing?</h3>
        <p>Once again, users will be able to view and interact with this list of the <a href="https://clincalc.com/DrugStats/Top300Drugs.aspx" target="_blank">300 most common medications</a>. To be more specific, users are able to view the details of these medications, refill information, and medication reminders. Every feature our users interface with will be derived from this information source.
      <h3>3. What kind of information will the users be viewing?</h3>
      <p>
        Once again, users will be able to view and interact with this list of
        the
        <a
          href="https://clincalc.com/DrugStats/Top300Drugs.aspx"
          target="_blank"
          >300 most common medications</a
        >. Every feature our users interface with will be derived from this
        information source.
      </p>

      <h3>4. How will the app help?</h3>
      <p>
        Searching and storing information from a list of canonical medication
        spellings will address the issue of medication names being difficult to
        recall and pronounce. Our "weekly pill planner" will remove the onus of
        remembering how to reset a physical pillbox each week. And counting
        pills, as well as remembering to refill prescriptions will be handled by
        our "prescription countdown" feature. With regards to the connection
        between these information issues and adherence: the list search will
        make it easier for patients and providers to agree on adherence
        expectations by facilitating accurate and informed communication, and the
        weekly planner will ensure that patients are continuously aware of their
        required dose, and the countdown will make patients less likely to skip
        doses while waiting for a refill.
